Dear Arturo

Happy New Year! Now is the time for you to improve your career prospects, enhance your employability and feel intellectually fulfilled. Study an online degree with The University of Edinburgh in 2018 and make the most of what online learning has to offer you – flexible courses delivered entirely online that fit around your personal and professional commitments.

More than 2 million students from across the globe have studied online courses and degrees with us, and more than 36,000 study on campus in Edinburgh itself, all attracted by the University’s top 50 global ranking* and world-leading research and teaching.

Designed for working professionals, our online Masters degrees let you build on existing knowledge, learn something new or fulfil professional development requirements. A Masters degree can help you stand out from the crowd, or allow you to progress to a new job in your chosen profession.

Join our global network of working professionals and learn while you earn. No need to relocate.

If you prefer to study on campus, then we also offer undergraduate and postgraduate degrees here at The University of Edinburgh. Study in an inspiring capital city, home to world-famous cultural festivals, and where the mountains and beaches of Scotland are right on your doorstep.

Join our world-class university online in 2018

Best wishes,

The University of Edinburgh
